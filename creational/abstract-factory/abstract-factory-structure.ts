// Although concrete factories instantiate concrete products, sig- natures of their creation methods must return corresponding abstract products. This way the client code that uses a facto- ry doesnâ€™t get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory.
// The Client can work with any concrete factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their objects via abstract interfaces.
